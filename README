KIND Linux Tools
selections from a sack of tools I have found usefull for:
-server administration
-testing/benchmarking purposes
-general helpers (see pagrs)

All these tools are licenced with the "kindly mention me" licence which I am too 
bored to write. For those needing details on the license here is the idea behind
it:

    "These works are published to be used.
     You are allowed and encouraged to use 
     and modify them for any purpose you
     can concieve.
     These works in general come with no
     guarantees whatsoever, you are to use 
     them on your own risk.
     If you do something illegal with 
     these works I will not be held 
     responsible.
     If you modify them, kindly mention my
     contribution. 
     Don't claim these works as yours and 
     don't claim derivatives are mine 
     unless they actually are my 
     derivatives."
     
Tools:
    subdirize:
        "Move files in the current directory into numbered sub directories."
    the source file has more information of how this works on its header        
    
    pargs:
        "an interesting way to read call arguments into a script"
    see the source file's header for more information
